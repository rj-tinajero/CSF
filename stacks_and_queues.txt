1. Stacks use the Last in First Out arrangement for its data.
Queues use the First In First Out arrangement for its data.

2. They both prioritize data with respect to how it is arranged. They are both data structure methodologies. 

3. For UNDO I would use the Stack(LIFO) data structure because whatever is just added would be the first to be removed.
For the REDO, I would also use the Stack because the redo will just re add whatever was taken off to the end of the list.

Programming questions
1. 
function reverseStr(str) {
    let strArr = str.split('');
    let rtsArr = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < strArr.length; i++) {
        let char = strArr.pop();
        rts.push(char);
    }
    return rtsArr.join('');
}

2.
function pop(q) {
    console.log(q.splice(-1, 1));
    return q;
}
pop([1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]);



3. 
function Queue() {
    this.data = ["eat", "sleep", "code"];
}

Queue.prototype.dequeue = function() {
    this.data.shift();
}
Queue.prototype.enqueue = function(x) {
    this.data.push(x);
}

const q = new Queue():
q.enqueue("repeat");

q.dequeue();
