1. Clean code is code that is easily readable and makes sense. It is important because others need to be able to understand your code if you are working on a team.

2. Another thing that is used by computers is heart rate monitors. If the code is not correct, it could lead to displaying the wrong information.

3. No because this function is doing two things, converting to celsius and fahrenheit. And too many comments.


FUNCTION fahrToCel(x, y)
 IF y = "F" THEN               
   SET z to (xâˆ’32) * (5/9)       
   PRINT z 
 ELSE
   PRINT "Already Celsius"
 END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION fahrToCel(x, y)
 IF y = "C" THEN               
   SET z to x * 1.8000 + 32.00        
   PRINT z 
 ELSE
   PRINT "Already Fahrenheit"
 END IF
END FUNCTION


4. No, the percentage variable is being printed out of scope. 

FUNCTION calcPercent(sum, total)
 IF NOT(total = 0) THEN
     SET percentage to sum / total * 100
     PRINT percentage
 ELSE
   PRINT "Sorry, cannot divide by 0"
 END IF

 END FUNCTION

FUNCTION checkOutCustomer(subTotal, discountRate, paymentType)
   INPUT totalDue = subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   PRINT "Your total due is: " + totalDue
   CALL getPayment RETURNING amount

   IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
       PRINT "Change due: " + amount - totalDue
   ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
       PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + totalDue
   END IF
END FUNCTION
