1. A function that reports the time it take for a program to run. This is helpful to see how efficient an algorithm is. 

2. Runtime is the physical time length of a program.

3. To find the runtime of a program, you need to add up the number of instructions the program 
will execute as a function of the size of the input and then simplify the expression to the largest 
term and drop any constants.

4. 
Constant GR
Logarithmic GR
Linear GR
Log-Linear GR
Quadratic GR
Cubic GR
Exponential GR

5. For linear GR, for email inboxes, you need to open every unread email in order for the count to reach zero.

6. time complexcity is O(n) 

7. time complexcity is O(n^2)

8. time complexcity is O(2^n) 

9. problem 6 is most efficient, Linear GR
