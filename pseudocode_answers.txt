Short Answer
1. Coders use pseudocode to write algorithms and express them without using a specific language syntax.
2. Nothing will really happen. 

Programming assignment
1. INPUT first number
   INPUT second number
   IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
	RETURN first number
   ELSE
	RETURN second number
   END IF

2. INIT number to 0
   WHILE number is less than 101
	ADD 1 to number
	RETURN number
   END WHILE

3. INPUT address
   INIT number equal to 0
   WHILE number is less than length of address book
	IF address equals contact
 		RETURN contact
	ELSE
		RETURN NULL
	END IF
   ADD 1 to number
   END WHILE

4. let search = function(address) {
    let contactsLength = contacts.length;
	for (let i = 0; i < contactsLength; i++) {
	    if(contacts[i].address == address) {
	        console.log(contacts[i]);
	        break;
	        }
	    }
}
