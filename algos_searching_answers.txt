1. Linear seacrh can be likened to looking through aisles in a grocery store to find what aisle has what you want.  
2. If you go through a phone book and look for an entry buy just turning to a random page. If that page entry is less than or greater than what you need, than you can forget that half of the phone book and keep searching. 
3. seven iterations
4. three iterations
5. I would choose linear search because binary search would only work for sorted collections. If you use binary sort, there would be no way of knowing is the middle value is perfectly in the middle relative to all other values because its not sorted. 
6. Would choose binary search because the collection is sorted so it would end up being much faster. 

Programming
1.
function dictionarySearch(arr, str) {
    let low = 0;
    let high = arr.length -1;
    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if(arr[mid] > str) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else if(arr[mid] < str) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            return mid;
        }
    };

}

2. 
function fishNet(arr) {
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === "white spotted goldfish") {
            return arr[i];
        }
    };
    return "Finished search, no white spotted goldfish found here!";
    
}
