1. Binary trees are trees where each node may point to a left child and a right child.
2. Heuristics are guesses that an algorithm makess to solve problems sooner by sacrificing accuracy. 
3. One problem can be speech recognition. The software can execute based on guesses of what the audio most sounds like. 
4. DFS searches start at the root node and move down along each branch and then backtracking up before checking the next branch.
 BFS traverses a tree or graph at the neighbor nodes first and then moves tot he next level and so on. 
5. A graph that permitts travel in either direction. The graph would also be a linked list or a tree because it doesnt loop. It also would not assign cost to travel between nodes.
6. A Binary search tree is undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph
